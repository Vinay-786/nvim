# About the repository

This is my neovim configuration. It's mostly [The Primeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen)'s configuration but i did some changes to my preferences.
_I don't use plugins like Harpoon(inbuilt "tabnew" in neovim does the job for me), undotree, vim-fugitive(I don't need them)_

## Setup

To reproduce the same configuration you need to install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
Then copy this repository into your ".config" folder in your home directory.
